Pietrek_DSP_paper includes data and code to estimate occupancy of Diademed Plovers (Phegornis mitchellii at Lagunas de Vilama, Jujuy.

datar contains data to estimate occupancy of Diademed Plovers (Phegornis mitchellii) at the RAMSAR site Lagunas de Vilama, Jujuy province, Argentina. Occupancy data were collected by Alejandro Pietrek, Bruce Lyon and Viviana Berrios following a removal design.Remotely-sensed variables were estimated by Andrea Izquierdo.

Variables:

OBJECTID: Peatland number as recorded in the GPS.
Vega: Peatland unique number.
ndwiMean: Mean NDWI from January 2019 to December 2021
ndwiMin: Minimum NDWI recorded across the three years.
ndwiMax: Maximum NDWI recorded across the three years.
ndwi_amp: ndwiMax-ndwiMin
NDVI_media: mean NDVI across the three years
NDVI_min: Minimum NDVI across the three years.
NDVI_max: Maximum NDVI across the three years.
NDVI_amp: NDVImax-NDVImin.
Shape_length: Peatland length in meters.
Shape_Area: Peatland area in hectares.
altura: Mean altitude the peatland is located at.
pendiente: Slope.
tpi: Topographic index.
Grazing: Estimated grazing pressure estimated in sheep equivalents.
coords: UTM coordinates for surveyed peatlands.
P1-P4: Detection history of Diademed Plovers

We included an additional data file (Territories_DSP), to estimate the approximate location of Diademed Plovers within a peatland. (Figure 2 on DSP paper).
